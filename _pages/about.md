I'm a PhD student at Charles Darwin University working on co-design of language technologies to support disaster communication in Indigenous communities.

Prior to this, I was a faculty member at the University of the Philippines, where I taught undergraduate courses and co-advised student research projects at the UP Electrical and Electronics Engineering Institute.
